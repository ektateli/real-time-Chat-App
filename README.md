DESCRIPTION


In the real-time chat app, I used Vite + React for building the frontend, enabling fast development and a dynamic user interface. TailwindCSS  were used for creating a responsive and modern design with pre-styled components. For real-time communication, I integrated Socket.IO client on the frontend. On the backend, Express.js was used to handle API requests and server routing, while MongoDB stored user data and chat messages. Cloudinary was utilized for storing and managing image uploads, and Socket.IO was also used on the backend to enable real-time messaging capabilities.

Features: The app offers real-time messaging, allowing users to chat instantly without refreshing the page. It supports user authentication, so users can log in, access their personal chat history, and send messages. Image and videos uploads are integrated, letting users share photos and videos directly in the chat, with images stored on Cloudinary. The responsive UI, designed with Tailwind CSSadapts to various screen sizes for a smooth experience on mobile and desktop devices.
